\section{Report Structure}
When writing up an assignment, always clearly structure your report with numbered headings and subheadings. Some reports use a standard format sectioned as Introduction, Methodology,  Results and Discussion, and Conclusions. In some cases, it might be better to structure your report with respect to assignment questions (i.e. sectioned as Question 1, Question 2, Question 3). In longer or more formal reports, it is best to include a title page and table of contents, as is shown in this document. These pages are generally not included in page counts, and as such are numbered using roman numerals. Otherwise, a title heading on the first page is sufficient. Remember never to include your name on assessments. Always use your SID.

Where a page format and font size is not specified, assume standard 1-inch margins and use a font size of at least 11 pt. Remember also that concise, grammatically correct writing is very important.
