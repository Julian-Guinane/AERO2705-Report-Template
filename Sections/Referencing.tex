\section{Referencing}
All work that isn't entirely your own must be referenced. In some subjects you will be asked to reference following a specific style guide. In this subject, we don't enforce a particular style, but you must remain consistent in your style. If you don't have a preferred referencing style, feel free to follow the \href{https://www.aiaa.org/publications/journals/reference-style-and-format}{AIAA Reference Style and Format Guide}. In engineering reports, footnote citation styles are generally avoided. It is best to use a numbered system. For example, in this sentence, I am writing something that requires referencing \cite{dirac}. Where a source is referenced in the text, it must be included in a bibliography at the end of the report. Bibliographies are generally not included in page counts. Below are some example citations so that you can see them in the bibliography:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \cite{dirac} is a book.
    \item \cite{einstein} is an article.
    \item \cite{knuthwebsite} is an online resource.
    \item \cite{knuth-fa} is a book chapter.
\end{itemize}
