\section{Overview}
This is a brief style guide that you can refer to when completing your your AERO2705 assignments. While other subjects may have modified style rules, this should be a handy reference for completing reports generally. This is by no means an exhaustive list, so always use your common sense when formatting your assessments and ask questions if you are unsure.

\paragraph{Note:} this is by no means the only way to work but will hopefully give you some extra guidance. I have added a longer list of examples with templates for common components (different figure types, tables types, etc.) in \Cref{app:StyleGuide}. You may want to use this repo as a template or take components out as you wish.
