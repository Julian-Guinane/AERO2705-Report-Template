\section{Report Structure}
When writing up an assignment, always clearly structure your report with numbered headings and subheadings. Some reports use a standard format such as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction
    \item Methodology
    \item Results and Discussion
    \item Conclusions
\end{enumerate}
In some cases, it might be better to structure your report with respect to assignment questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Question 1
    \item Question 2
    \item Question 3
\end{enumerate}
It is up to you to decide what is most suitable.

\section{Equations}
Below are some examples of well formatted equations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single line equation: \input{StyleGuide/Templates/EqSingleLine}
    \item Aligned equations: \input{StyleGuide/Templates/EqAligned}
    \item Sub-equations: \input{StyleGuide/Templates/EqSubeqs}
    \item Split equations: \input{StyleGuide/Templates/EqSplit}
    \item Multiple equations in one line (avoid in general): \input{StyleGuide/Templates/EqMultiOneLine}
\end{itemize}
Key points to remember are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Equations must always be numbered and referred to in the body of the text.
    \item It is very rare that equations are placed \textit{inline}. For example, $\curl{\vb{B}} = \mu_0\qty(\vb{J} + \varepsilon_0 \pdv{E}{t})$ is poorly formatted and hard to read. It is much better to place the equation in a separate line and refer to it, as in \Cref{eq:DisplayMath}.
    \item While it is usually up to personal preference, be consistent when defining equations as either:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Defined inside of sentence:
            \begin{equation}
                c^2 = a^2 + b^2
            \end{equation}
        where $c$ is the hypotenuse side-length, and $a$ and $b$ are the other side lengths.
        \item Or defined separately and referred to, as in \Cref{eq:Refer}, where $\vb{E}$ is the electric field, $\rho$ is the charge density, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:Refer}
            \div{\vb{E}} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}
    Whichever style you choose is normally fine, as long as you only use one throughout your report.
    \item Where a variable represents a vector, always denote is as such using bold notation ($\vb{v}$) or arrow notation ($\va{v}$). Again, remain consistent in using one or the other.
\end{itemize}
